#What is it for?
_Matrix_ is written to help programmers work with matrices easily and with as little efforts as possible. It also aims for code readability and simple logic. There's no need to work with vectors or arrays in your code (while that's what is used under the hood). You work with objects that implement some basic operations (like multiplication, addidion, etc).

#How to use
It's planned to distribute _Matrix_ as a library, but as for now, it's distributed simply as some source files with no binaries. To use _Matrix_ you need to `#include "Matrix.hpp"` and then compile your project _with the files that belong to Matrix_.

#Any examples, please?
Well, `main.cpp` is an example. You need to compile it and that's all.
