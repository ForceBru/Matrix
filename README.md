# Matrix
User-friendly way to perform operations with matrices. Supports OpenCL for calculations on GPU.

> ###Warning!

> This project is now in active development, so it may contain bugs and unstable code. If you find any, please let me know.

##What is it for?
_Matrix_ is written to help programmers work with matrices easily and with as little efforts as possible. It also aims for code readability and simple logic. There's no need to work with vectors or arrays in your code (while that's what is used under the hood). You work with objects that implement some basic operations (like multiplication, addition, etc).

##Dependencies and requirements
Absolutely _no dependencies_ except for a C/C++ runtime (and OpenCL if needed). Requires a C++ compiler to be built.

> Documentation and examples of usage are available in the [Matrix Wiki](https://github.com/ForceBru/Matrix/wiki)
